# Todo list

[Live preview](https://sarav929.github.io/todo-list/)

This is a Todo List website where users can create projects with a list of tasks to complete by a certain date, built as part of the Odin Project. The page was developed using Webpack, with a focus on keeping DOM manipulation and app logic as separate as possible in different JavaScript files.

To handle projects and tasks, I created a class for each. The assignment also required that projects and tasks be saved to local storage, allowing users to access their data across different sessions using JSON for saving and retrieving information. I used date-fns for handling dates throughout the application.

Note: This version has been tested on desktop only, and I plan to add styling for smaller screens in the future.
